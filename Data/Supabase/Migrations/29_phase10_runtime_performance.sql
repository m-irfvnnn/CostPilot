-- ============================================
-- CostPilot Phase 10 — Hosted runtime performance corrections
-- ============================================
-- Keeps the existing Retool and RPC contracts intact while removing the two
-- main timeout paths exposed by the larger Phase 10 historical demo cohort:
--   * gtm_sales_workload_summary no longer depends on current_sales_queue
--   * account_health_signal_assembly no longer re-nests account_dashboard_overview
